# Quantum Kernel SVM for Classification

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Quantum Kernel Estimation (QKE) with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying data generated using the `make_circles` dataset from scikit-learn. The QKE method leverages a variational quantum circuit to compute a kernel matrix, which is then used by the SVM classifier.

## Usage
Step 1: Import necessary libraries
The necessary libraries for this project are imported, including PennyLane for quantum computing, scikit-learn for dataset generation and machine learning, and other utilities like joblib and matplotlib for parallel computing and plotting, respectively.

Step 2: Load and visualize the dataset
The make_circles dataset is generated and plotted to visualize the two classes.

Step 3: Define the quantum feature map and variational circuit
A quantum feature map and variational circuit are defined using PennyLane. The circuit is parameterized and will be optimized to compute the kernel matrix.

Step 4: Compute the Quantum Kernel Matrix (QEK)
The QEK matrix is computed by measuring the overlap between the quantum states of different data points.

Step 5: Optimize the quantum kernel parameters
The parameters of the quantum feature map are optimized to maximize the kernel-target alignment.

Step 6: Train and evaluate the SVM classifier
An SVM classifier is trained using the optimized QEK matrix, and its performance is evaluated on the test set.

Step 7: Plot the SVM decision boundary
The decision boundary of the SVM classifier with the quantum kernel is plotted.

## Detailed Explanation
Quantum Kernel Estimation (QKE)
Quantum Kernel Estimation (QKE) leverages the power of quantum computing to map classical data into a high-dimensional quantum feature space. The kernel matrix, which is a measure of the similarity between data points in this feature space, is computed using a variational quantum circuit. The variational circuit is parameterized and optimized to improve the kernel's effectiveness for a given classification task.

Variational Quantum Circuit
A variational quantum circuit is a parameterized quantum circuit that can be optimized to perform specific tasks. In this project, the circuit parameters are optimized to maximize the kernel-target alignment, which measures how well the quantum kernel separates the classes in the training data.

Kernel-Target Alignment
Kernel-target alignment is a measure of the effectiveness of a kernel for a given classification task. It is computed as the inner product between the kernel matrix and the target label matrix. By optimizing the kernel parameters to maximize this alignment, we improve the classifier's ability to distinguish between classes.

SVM with Precomputed Kernel
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a popular class of classifiers that work well with kernel methods. In this project, we use an SVM with a precomputed kernel, where the kernel matrix is computed using the optimized quantum kernel. This approach allows us to leverage the power of quantum computing to improve the performance of classical SVMs.

## Results
The quantum kernel SVM classifier achieved a classification accuracy of approximately accuracy on the make_circles dataset. The decision boundary plot shows the regions classified as different classes by the SVM using the quantum kernel.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how to integrate quantum computing with classical machine learning algorithms to perform kernel-based classification. By leveraging the power of quantum feature maps, the SVM classifier can potentially achieve better performance on complex datasets.
